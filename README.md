# Isaac Lab Tutorial: From Quadruped to Humanoid Locomotion

[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

An in-depth, 10-chapter tutorial on developing reinforcement learning environments for legged robots in **NVIDIA Isaac Lab**. This tutorial guides users from running a baseline example with a quadruped (Unitree Go2) to tackling the advanced challenge of humanoid locomotion (Unitree H1).

Each chapter has its own dedicated branch, allowing you to easily follow along or check out the completed code for any part of the tutorial.
